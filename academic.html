											<h2>A Dynamic Model of U.S. Beef Cattle </h2>
											<h4><i>Dinesh R Poddaturi, Chad E Hart, Lee L Schulz</i></h4>
									</header>
									<p> A structural dynamic economic model of the U.S. beef cattle industry is developed. The dynamic
model is built upon a bottom-up framework, where the fundamentals of farmers’ behavior,
biological constraints of the beef cattle, age distribution and gender composition of cattle,
and micro-foundations are incorporated. The data-driven structural model is calibrated (under Naïve price expectations and Rational price expectations) to adequately capture the dynamics observed in the U.S. beef cattle industry. The calibrated
model is then used to project the beef cattle market variables (prices and quantities) into the
future. Besides studying the beef industry structure and the dynamics of the beef cattle, the
dynamic model can also be used to run counterfactual simulations to analyze policy impacts
on the beef cattle industry and make important recommendations, making the model an
interest to policymakers, industry stakeholders, and beef cattle farmers. </p>

											<h2>Implementing a National Animal Identification and Traceability Program: Economic Assessment using a
                          Dynamic Model of U.S. Beef Cattle</h2>
											<h4><i>Dinesh R Poddaturi, Chad E Hart, Lee L Schulz</i></h4>
									</header>
									<p> This study quantifies the economic impacts of a mandatory national animal identification
and traceability system on the U.S. beef cattle producers. Using a dynamic model of the U.S. beef
cattle and rich cattle industry data, we estimate the short-run and long-run impacts and how these
impacts change over time. In particular, we quantify the producer surplus losses from traceability
systems. We show how the prices and quantities would change with the increased costs associated
with the traceability system. In the short-run, the aggregate change in producer surplus is negative.
Over time, the losses in producer surplus decline and in the long-run the producer surplus would be
positive. We also quantify the changes in producer surplus with different cost-sharing programs
under different adoption rates. </p>

											<h2>Autoregressive Tempered Fractionally Integrated Moving Average Model</h2>
											<h4><i>Dinesh R Poddaturi</i></h4>
									</header>
 <!--<p>As a part of my creative component for my master degree in Statistics, I analyzed Autoregressive Tempered Fractionally Integrated Moving Average Model and it's applications to real world data.</p>-->
 
 <p>The objective of this work is to learn the ARTFIMA time series model and use it to fit real world data and compare the model with Autoregressive Fractionally Integrated Moving Average (ARFIMA) model in terms of goodness of fit and predictions. The ARTFIMA model is a short range dependent time series that exhibits semi-long range dependency. For small values of tempering parameter λ > 0, the spectral density behaves like a power law at low frequencies, and it remains bounded as frequency reaches to zero. ARTFIMA can be extended to ARFIMA when the tempered paramater λ is zero, and to Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA, which is most commonly used time series model) when both tempered parameter λ and difference parameter d are zero. We can consider ARTFIMA model as a generalized time series model, where as both ARFIMA and ARMA are the extensions of ARTFIMA.</p>

											<h2>Development of a CRUSH Margin Calculator for Beef and Pork Markets </h2>
											<h4><i>Dinesh R Poddaturi, Garland Dahlke, Russ Euken, Lee L Schulz</i></h4>
									</header>
									<p> A convenient, web-based application was developed that utilizes Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) futures settlement price data to generate an expected margin. Futures price data is available for live cattle, feeder cattle, lean hogs, soybean meal, and corn. The prices of these commodities on the futures market can be hedged in advance of cash purchases or sales to reduce price risk or used to estimate potential margins when producing and selling fed cattle or market hogs.</p>

											<h2>Management Minder – A web based Data Management Application</h2>
											<h4><i>Dinesh R Poddaturi, Garland Dahlke, Sandy Johnson</i></h4>
									</header>
									<p>Management Minder is a web based application developed as a joint project between the Iowa Beef Center and Kansas State University allowing beef cattle producers to manage their day to day schedule regarding cattle nutrition, reproduction, health and herd management. Producers can create a customized calendar and share it with their employees, consultants, and veterinarians over the internet. This application also provides web links containing useful information regarding “best management practices” in regards to these different activities.  Content was primarily a contribution by collaborators at Kansas State University.  Software development and site hosting was the responsibility of the Iowa Beef Center.</p>
									<p>Softwares used in the development of the application are Java, MySQL, and Apache Tomcat. These open source softwares are used to develop a web application with high performance, less maintenance, low cost, and low overhead/computing.</p>
